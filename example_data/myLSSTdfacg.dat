# Make up for missed observing epochs.  The weather is very good at the

# to make up.

# Note that the camera only holds five filters and thus each night
# only five filters can be used.  The above will result, barring
# missed observations, in the ugriz filters every 3 nights, and the
# y filter on the nights after the ugriz observations.  The algorithm 
# is to displace the last filter in the list by a day when six filters 
# are asked for on one night.

# On to the next field, only observed for 5 years, for example.
# Currently limited to 100 fields, but this could easily changed.
# Let cinabro know if 100 fields is not enough.
